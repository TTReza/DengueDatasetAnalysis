# DengueDatasetAnalysis
I have tried to do some basic data analysis on the dataset provided. Here are some key findings:

* There are 11 regions where the affected people number is greater than 15. They are:
Badda
Bangshal
Demra
Dhanmondi
Jatrabari
Kadamtoli
Kafrul
Mirpur
Khilkhet
Mohammadpur
Tejgaon

* The dataset is well-balanced with each column which is good.
* Even there there are developed areas, among them Jatrabari has the highest number of dengue patients in spite of being developed. I can also estimate that the areas of Jatrabari, Bongshal, Khilkhet and Demra have unhygienic environments
